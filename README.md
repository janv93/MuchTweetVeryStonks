THIS APP IS CURRENTLY WIP - I DOES NOT YET CLOSE THE POSITIONS


How to use:

Rename the \_.env file to .env and place necessary api keys there. Then run npm start.
To run the app 24/7 for free, just use Heroku and configure the environment variables in the Settings tab under "Config Vars". Tested and works.
