# MuchTweetVeryStonks

This script is listening to Elon's tweets and longs Doge if the tweet contains doge. Also some safety mechanisms.

How to use:

Rename the \_.env file to .env and place necessary api keys there. Then run npm start.  
To run the app locally, run npm start and open browser http://127.0.0.1:3000/


Currently this code only runs for a few days. Eventually the polling has to be changed to a stream mechanism.
