How to use:

Rename the \_.env file to .env and place necessary api keys there. Then run npm start.
To run the app 24/7, use Heroku and configure the environment variables in the Settings tab under "Config Vars". Tested and works. Free tier is limited to 30 min runtime unfortunately. You can also use a raspberry pi instead.
To run the app locally, run npm start and open browser http://127.0.0.1:3000/
